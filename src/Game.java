/**
 *  This class is the main class of the "Sector Alpha" application. 
 *  "Sector Alpha" is a sci-fi game based on an abandoned spaceship.
 *  Players start in the docks of the spaceship where they were summoned 
 *  after the spaceship sent a distress signal. 
 *  
 *  The players walk around, interact with objects and NPCs to find out 
 *  what happened on the ship. The goal is to save as many people from the ship 
 *  as the player can. 
 *  All NPCs require some objects to agree to leave the ship - to become saveable. 
 *  Some NPCs are however dangerous and if you attempt to save them, you will die. 
 *  Clues are given throughout the map to help the player determine who to save.
 * 
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method. This is currently done via the MainClass in order to make the
 *  game runnable.
 * 
 *  This class holds the main play routine, which consists of initializing the 
 *  map, creating a character and interpreting commands until either the player
 *  loses by attempting to save the wrong NPC, wins the game by saving all 
 *  the right NPCs or supplies the "quit" command.
