/**
 * This class is part of the "Sector Alpha" application.   
 *
 * This class holds information about a command that was issued by the user.
 * A command consists of two or three strings: a command word and a second
 * part, which can be either one or two words. The third word only is 
 * used in the "give" command and "go" command when the room has a name 
 * consisting of two words.
 * 
 * The way this is used is: Commands are already checked for being valid
 * command words. If the user entered an invalid command (a word that is not
 * known) then the command word is null.
 *
 * If the command had only one word, then the second word is null.
